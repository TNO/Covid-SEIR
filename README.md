The program has been tested under python 3.7


To run a calibration and forecast:

1. Create a .json configuration file. Several example files are provided in this repository in the configs directory
    china.json
    korea.json
    netherlands_march14.json
    netherlands_march21.json
    netherlands_march26.json

2. run  corona_mc.py (for the loglikelyhood mode)  or corona_esmda.py (for the ensemble soother model)
from the bin directory as working directory, so the settings (e.g. in pycharm should be)
```json
For corona_mc.py
  script path: {your git corona dir}/bin/corona_mc.py
  parameters: {your git corona dir}../configs/netherlands_march26.json
  working directory {your git corona dir}/bin
For corona_esmda.py
  script path: {your git corona dir}/bin/corona_mc.py
  parameters: {your git corona dir}../configs/netherlands_march26.json
  working directory {your git corona dir}/bin
```

3. formats of input and meaning of parameters

China.json :

        # in corona_esmda.py these are fit to data
  "dayalpha" : [1, 7, 20], # days at which alfa starts
  "hosfrac" : 0.17,       # relative fraction of infected people hospitalized, default 0.05 but higher for china to

```
  *For the times to move from Removed in the SEIR model to recover or  die, we used in the WHO paper very simple settings for the hospital flow, resulting in an average stay of ICU patients of 14 days. In the mean time we improved the flow parameters as depicted  below. In order to be in agreement with the WHO paper, below we show settings in accordance with the average stay. The ICUdfrac has been set artificilly to 0.0 to obtain results which are very similar to the WHO paper results.  Evidently the flow diagram allows realistic settings in accordance with country specific or time dependent measures*

}
```
4 . own input files:

    In the Netherlands input file, cusroim data is loaded including information on hospitalization, The files should be a txt file as corona_dataNL26.txt with  6 columns
``` #  column 0 -  day
    #  column 1 - cumulative registered infected (postive test cases)
    #  column 2  - cum  dead
    #  column 3 - cum recovered
    #  column 4 - cumulative hospitalized
    #  column 5 - actual IC units used (may be estimated or 0)
```
5 . output files

corona_mc/esmda will create several plots and a datafile in csv format in the output directory.

Output file names start with the json name and corona_mc.py
generates hindcast and forecast  (shown in paper appendix, and fig. 3) as well as ensemble plots.data
corona_esmda generates prior and posterior ensembles of dead, hospitalized, etc

The csv file can be used for further post_processing, containing confidence intervals, which can be plotted elseweher

6 . errors
If a config keyword is misspelled or mssing this easily results in an error, please provide all keywors
if output writing gives an error make sure your you working directory is at bin
